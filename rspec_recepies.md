###Working with rspec 

```

```

### How to run tests with rspec
```
rspec path/to/test/file
```
You can make the test output more verbose by using this command

```
rspec path/to/test/file --format documentation
```
###Use the expect syntax and not the old should syntax
You can read all about that in [here](http://rspec.info/blog/2012/06/rspecs-new-expectation-syntax/)

lib/zombie.rb 

```
class Zombie
    attr_accessor :name, :brains 
    def initialize  
        @name = "Ash"
        @brains = 0
    end 

end
```

spec/lib/zombie_spec.rb
```
require 'spec_helper'
require 'zombie'

describe Zombie do 
    it "is named Ash" do
        zombie = Zombie.new 
        expect(zombie.name).to eq("Ash")
    end 
    
end
```

###Matchers 
rspec-expecations provides a number of useful Matchers we use to compose expectations. A Matcher is any object that responds to the following methods:

```
matches?(actual)
failure_message_for_should
```
These methods are also part of the matcher protocol, but are optional:

```
does_not_match?(actual)
failure_message_for_should_not
description #optional
```

#####Predicates
In addition to those Expression Matchers that are defined explicitly, RSpec will create custom Matchers on the fly for any arbitrary predicate, giving your specs a much more natural language feel.

A Ruby predicate is a method that ends with a “?” and returns true or false. Common examples are empty?, nil?, and instance_of?.

All you need to do is write should be_ followed by the predicate without the question mark, and RSpec will figure it out from there. For example:

```
[].should be_empty => [].empty? #passes
[].should_not be_empty => [].empty? #fails
```

In addtion to prefixing the predicate matchers with “be_”, you can also use “be_a_” and “be_an_”, making your specs read much more naturally:

```
"a string".should be_an_instance_of(String) =>"a string".instance_of?(String) #passes

3.should be_a_kind_of(Fixnum) => 3.kind_of?(Numeric) #passes
3.should be_a_kind_of(Numeric) => 3.kind_of?(Numeric) #passes
3.should be_an_instance_of(Fixnum) => 3.instance_of?(Fixnum) #passes
3.should_not be_instance_of(Numeric) => 3.instance_of?(Numeric) #fails
```
##### equal matcher
the equal matcher test for identical objects in memory

Note: expect does not support == matcher 

##### Despricated matchers
The 'have' matchers was deprecated a long time a go

#####Testing predicates that you have defined in the class
Examples
spec/lib/zombie_spec.rb
```
require 'spec_helper'
require 'zombie'

describe Zombie do 
    it "is named Ash" do
        zombie = Zombie.new 
        expect(zombie.name).to eq("Ash")
    end 

    it "has no brains" do
        zombie = Zombie.new
        expect(zombie.brains).to be < 1
    end 

    it "is hungry" do 
        zombie = Zombie.new 
        expect(zombie).to be_hungry # testing the predicate hungry
    end 
    
end
```

lib/zombie.rb

```
class Zombie
    attr_accessor :name, :brains 
    def initialize  
        @name = "Ash"
        @brains = 0
    end 

    def hungry?
        true
    end 
end
```

###Pending tests
There are three ways to make tests pend
* leave the body of the it empty
Example 

```
describe Zombie do 
    it "is named Ash" do
        # leave the body of it empty
end 
```

* add x before it
Example 
```
describe Zombie do 
    xit "is named Ash" do # xit makes this pend
        zombie = Zombie.new 
        expect(zombie.name).to eq("Ash")
    end 
end 
```

* Use the pending key word
Example 

```
describe Zombie do 
    it "is named Ash" do
        pending
        zombie = Zombie.new 
        expect(zombie.name).to eq("Ash")
    end 
end
```
###using #method name in the it block
Example

```
describe Book do
    before :each do
        @book = Book.new "Title", "Author", :category
    end

    it "#new" do
    end 
end
```
We might want to use #method name because the output of the test will be something like this

Book#new which is ClassName#methodName. This is a ruby convention for instance methods

###[Before blocks](http://www.rubydoc.info/gems/rspec-core/RSpec%2FCore%2FHooks%3Abefore) 
Module: RSpec::Core::Hooks
before is often used to perform actions common across tests. There are three scopes that you can use with before
** :each or :example 
** :all or :context
** :suite

before :each means run the block before each test. 
before :all means run the block once before all the tests

###[describe vs. context in rspec](http://lmws.net/describe-vs-context-in-rspec) 
According to the [rspec source code](https://github.com/rspec/rspec-core/blob/master/lib/rspec/core/example_group.rb), “context” is just an alias method of “describe”, meaning that there is no functional difference between these two methods. However, there is a contextual difference that’ll help to make your tests more understandable by using both of them.

The purpose of “describe” is to wrap a set of tests against one functionality while “context” is to wrap a set of tests against one functionality under the same state. Here’s an example

```
describe "launch the rocket" do
  before(:each) do
    #prepare a rocket for all of the tests
    @rocket = Rocket.new
  end
 
  context "all ready" do
    before(:each) do
      #under the state of ready
      @rocket.ready = true
    end
 
    it "launch the rocket" do
      @rocket.launch().should be_true
    end
  end
 
  context "not ready" do
    before(:each) do
      #under the state of NOT ready
      @rocket.ready = false
    end
 
    it "does not launch the rocket" do
      @rocket.launch().should be_false
    end
  end
end
```
